The live funding/bidding system allows startups to present their business to investors in real-time. Investors bid with funding offers in exchange for a percentage of future revenues. Startups can review multiple bids and choose the one that best fits their financial and strategic goals, making fundraising a competitive and transparent process.
The royalty-based funding model enables startups to secure investment in exchange for a share of their revenue. Unlike equity funding, this model does not require giving up company ownership. Investors receive a percentage of revenue until a predetermined amount is repaid, aligning investor returns with business growth.
Royalty percentages, such as 10% or 9%, are determined based on investment amount, projected revenue, and industry trends. The platform employs a valuation model to suggest fair royalty rates, and startups can negotiate better terms during live funding rounds.
Startups can negotiate the royalty percentage with investors during the live funding round, ensuring they secure investment on favorable terms. Open communication and a well-prepared financial projection increase the chances of a beneficial agreement.
The platform verifies investor identities through document authentication, financial background checks, and AI-driven fraud detection. This ensures only legitimate investors participate, protecting startups from scams or fake profiles.
Startup validation involves a verification process that includes business registration confirmation, founder identity checks, and product or service legitimacy assessments. This safeguards the platform against fraudulent startup listings.
The profile matching algorithm pairs startups with investors based on industry, funding stage, and business potential. This increases efficiency by connecting startups with investors whose interests align with their business goals.
During live funding rounds, startups can access bid history to track investor interest and compare offers. This transparency helps founders make informed funding decisions and negotiate better deals.
The �score out of 100� evaluates startups based on revenue growth, market traction, investor interest, and business sustainability. Improving this score requires strong financial performance, customer engagement, and a compelling pitch.
Pitch videos can be uploaded via the startup dashboard, following platform guidelines for clarity, conciseness, and professional presentation. A strong pitch should highlight the problem, solution, market potential, and financial strategy.
If multiple funding offers with different royalty percentages are received, startups can compare terms, investor reputation, and funding amounts before making a decision. Selecting the right investor involves considering both financial and strategic benefits.
If an investor declines an offer after an offline meeting, startups can explore alternative investors from previous bids or seek further discussions to adjust the agreement terms.
