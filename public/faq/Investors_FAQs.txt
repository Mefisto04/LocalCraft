The live funding/bidding system enables investors to participate in real-time funding rounds where they can evaluate startups and place bids offering funding in exchange for a royalty percentage. Startups receive multiple bids and choose the best offer based on funding amount, investor credibility, and proposed royalty rates. This dynamic approach ensures competitive funding opportunities for both investors and startups.
The royalty-based funding model allows investors to earn a percentage of the startup's revenue until a predetermined limit is reached. This structure benefits both parties by aligning investor returns with business success. Investors calculate their percentage based on investment size, expected revenue growth, and the startup�s industry potential. Adjustments to royalty percentages can be made during live funding rounds to stay competitive based on other bids.
To ensure legitimacy, startups undergo a rigorous verification process that includes submitting business registration documents, financial records, and identity verification. The platform employs AI-driven fraud detection and manual review to filter out fake profiles. Similarly, investors are required to validate their identity, financial standing, and past investment history to build a trustworthy funding ecosystem.
The profile matching algorithm enhances investor-startup connections by analyzing investment preferences, previous funding history, and industry focus. This automated system suggests relevant startups that align with the investor's objectives, saving time and increasing the chances of successful investments.
Investors can access bid histories to understand competitive interest in a startup and adjust their offers accordingly. The �score out of 100� is an algorithm-based rating that evaluates startup traction, revenue growth, market position, and investor engagement. A higher score signifies a well-validated startup with strong potential. Investors should use this score to gauge startup reliability before making funding decisions.
Startups provide pitch videos as part of their profiles, and investors can analyze them to assess the founders� vision, business viability, and scalability. A compelling pitch highlights product-market fit, competitive advantages, and financial projections.
If multiple investors bid on the same startup, the founder selects the most attractive offer, considering funding amount, royalty rate, and investor credibility. If an investor�s offer is declined post-meeting, they can explore other startups or negotiate better terms. The �Digital Twin� feature will enable investors to create virtual business models that simulate a startup�s projected growth, helping them make informed investment decisions.
